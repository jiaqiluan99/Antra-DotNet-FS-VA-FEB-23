1. Describe the problem generics address.
    Keeps type-safety:  consistency between variables
    High performance:   no unwanted boxing
    Flexibility:        can handle different types
    Maintainability:    easier to maintain since all the variables with the same generic type parameter
                        needs to match in type
    
2. How would you create a list of strings, using the generic List class?
    List<String> strings = new List<String>();

3. How many generic type parameters does the Dictionary class have?
    Two parameters

4. True/False. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match.
    F

5. What method is used to add items to a List object?
    Add()

6. Name two methods that cause items to be removed from a List.
    Remove()
    RemoveAll()

7. How do you indicate that a class has a generic type parameter?
    <T>

8. True/False. Generic classes can only have one generic type parameter.
    F

9. True/False. Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type.
    T

10. True/False. Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to.
    F
